# Welcome to My First Page
## This is a part of my project for a course called 'NarzÄ™dzia Informatyczne'
### Here is something about myself

Hi, my name is Julia and this is my first website. It is created as a part of my project made for the course 'ISI' at AGH.

- My name is _Julia_
- I study _Informatics_
- I want to learn _Programming_

## My project - 'Physycist's Toolbox'

ðŸš€ Check it out on GitHub [HERE](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne/Physicist-s-Toolbox) ðŸš€

ðŸ’¡ With my team I menaged to successfully write a console aplication, which allows users to solve many physics problems. It provides help in multiple areas of physics at an advanced level

ðŸ’¡ What could still be perfected?
- There is always room for improvement. Physics is such a wide area of science, that it is not possible to elaborate on all of its branches in the short amount of time we had. In the future we could expand on the topics that are included in our program or add some more.

ðŸ’¡ How does it work?
- Our App has a really intuitive interface. You can pick a branch of Physics in which you are interested in. You can choose from:
  - kinematics
  - dynamics
  - thermodynamics
  - gravitation
  - electrostatics
  - optics
 

**Thank you for your attention!**
