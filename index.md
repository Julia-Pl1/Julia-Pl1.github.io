# Welcome to My First Page
## This is a part of my project for a course called 'NarzÄ™dzia Informatyczne'
### Here is something about myself

Hi, my name is Julia and this is my first website. It is created as a part of my project made for the course 'ISI' at AGH.

- My name is _Julia_
- I study _Informatics_
- I want to learn _Programming_

## My project - 'Physycist's Toolbox'

With my team I menaged to successfully write a console aplication, which allows users to solve many physics problems. It provides help in multiple areas of physics at an advanced level. It relieves users of the obligation of calculating many extremely complicated equations.

ðŸ’¡ What caused us a little trouble?
At first we found it difficult to efficiently communicate using slack, as it was a tool, that hadn't been encountered by any member of our team. However, after a little bit of time we got used to this new way of staying in touch with one another and since then we have been able to discuss all our concepts throughly.

ðŸ’¡ What could still be perfected?
There is always room for improvement and so our project could always be enhanced. Physics is such a wide area of science, that it is not possible to elaborate on all of its branches in the short amount of time we had. In the future we could expand on the topics that are included in our program or add some more.

**Thank you for your attention!**
